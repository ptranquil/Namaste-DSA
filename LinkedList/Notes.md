# Linked List
    - Linear data structure
    - Nodes are linked together by a reference field
    - Head is the starting point of the linked
    - The last element is the tail of the linked list which points to null

# Types of linked list
    - Singly Linked List
        Has value and 1 pointer to the next node
    - Doubly Linked List
        - Has value and 2 pointer, 1 to the previous node and 1 to the next node

# How its different from Arrays
    - Linked List
        1. Linear
        2. Contiguous
        3. Dynamic Size 
        4. Node = Values + pointers
        5. Getting element is hard. TC:  O(n)
        6. Insertion, deletion is easy
        7. Extra memory (for node and reference)
    
    - Array
        1. Linear
        2. Contiguous
        3. Fixed size (can be dynamic)
        4. Just value
        5. Getting element is easy. TC: O(1)
        6. Insertion, deletion is complex
        7. Memory Effecient (one 1 memory location require to store a value)
