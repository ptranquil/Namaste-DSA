# RECURSION
    - Function calling itself to solve smaller version of the same problem

# Two parts of recusion
    - Base Case: Stop condition, when to stop the function
    - Recusive Case: When function call itself

# Real life E.g.  
    1. Queue of people
    2. Common Thread
    3. Organizational Heirarchies

Running into infinite recusion will endup in a stack overflow
Time complexity of recursion id O(n)
Use Recursion whenever the problem can be broken down into sub problem
